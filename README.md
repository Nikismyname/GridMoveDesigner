This is a visual designer alpha for GridMove: https://github.com/jgpaiva/GridMove.
This project allows you to visually design the grid(window snapping grid) which GridMove will apply. 
It creates .grid text files which GridMove reads.

If you install it on a system drive, you might need to run it as administrator. Also if you generate the text file on the system drive you will need to run it as administrator. This is because the program reads from file and also creates files.

The shortcuts are in the menu. 
You need to pass valid directory and file name in the menu and save to get to the grid design part.
The interface is not very well designed but remember that this is just a prototype.
